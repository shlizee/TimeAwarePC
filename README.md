# TimeAwarePC: A Python Package for Finding Causal Connectivity from Time Series Data [![image](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/timeawarepc.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/timeawarepc) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/timeawarepc/badge/?version=latest)](https://timeawarepc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)
**TimeAwarePC** is a Python package that implements the Time-Aware PC Algorithm for finding the **Causal Functional Connectivity** from time series data, based on recent research in directed probabilistic graphical modeling with time series [[1]](#Citation). The package also includes implementations of Granger Causality and the PC algorithm.

## Installation

You can get the latest version of TimeAwarePC as follows.

```
$ pip install timeawarepc
```

## Requirements
- Python >=3.7, <3.11
- Python packages automatically checked and installed as part of the setup. To use Granger Causality, additional dependency of ```nitime``` which can be installed by ```pip install nitime```.
- R == 4.4.2
- R package ```kpcalg``` and its dependencies. They can be installed in R or RStudio as follows:
```
> install.packages("BiocManager")
> BiocManager::install("graph")
> BiocManager::install("RBGL")
> install.packages("pcalg")
> install.packages("https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/kpcalg/kpcalg_1.0.1.tar.gz")
```
<!-- - In addition, if you like to use Granger Causality functions in this package, please separately install nitime as follows:
```
pip install nitime
``` -->
